# 🧮 Standards

## 📐 How Standards Work?
Each standard is identified by a unique standard id (e.g., `ST0001`) and paired with a modification number (`M1`, `M2`, etc.). Only the modification number changes when the meaning or context of the standard changes.

### 📝 Example:
- You publish a new standard: `ST0001-M1`.

- Later, you fix a typo or grammar issue — without changing the standard's purpose — you keep it as `M1`, but simply update the updated date.

- If you change the purpose, logic, or context of the standard, then you must release it as a new modification, like `ST0001-M2`.

### 🔁 Summary:
- ✏️ Minor changes (grammar, typos): ✅ Keep same id and modification (e.g., `M1`), only update the updated date.

- 🔄 Major changes (meaning or intent): 🔁 Increase modification number (e.g., `M2`, `M3`, ...).
